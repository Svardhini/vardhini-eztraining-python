classifications:
1.predefined functions
2.user defined functions
--for code reusability we use functions.
.....lets say we want to use a particular concept multiple times in our program instead of writing the same code many times we can write it once 
include that inside a function and can call the function whereever we need it.
TYPES:
1.Functions without argument and without return value
2.Functions without argument and with return value
3.Functions with argument and with return value
4.Functions with argument and without return value
