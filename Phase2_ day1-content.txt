
lambda function:
It is called as anonymous function.when we want to use function concepts alone without using function name,there we apply concept of lambda function.
Four pillars of oops:
1.abstraction:hiding the implementation part and showing only information required for the user.
ex:exe file
*We can make class or method as abstract,opposite to abstract is concrete.
2.encapsulation:Binding data and functions into a single entity
a.public---one class info can be accessed by any other class
b.private---can be used where it is declared/no in inherited class
protected---can  be accessed only where it got declared......which ever class inherited from this class there also we can use.it is taken as _d,_f etc...
3.inheritance:Base class and derived class
baseclass-parentclass or mainclass
Derived class-child class
Derived class inherits properties of base class.
types of inheritance:
 --->Single
---->Multiple
---->Multi level
---->Heirarchial
--->Hybrid
4.polymorphism:
